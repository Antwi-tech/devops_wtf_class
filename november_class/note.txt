Common SMTP server ports are
25, 465, 587, and 2525, with 587 being the recommended port for secure email submission, 465 for legacy SMTPS, and 25 for server-to-server communication. Many major email providers use these ports, such as Gmail (smtp.gmail.com on port 587) and Microsoft 365 (smtp.office365.com on port 587). 
 
Common SMTP ports
 
Port 25: The original SMTP port, now mainly used for server-to-server email relay and often blocked to prevent spam.
Port 465: A legacy port for encrypted email using SMTP Secure (SMTPS). It is used when a direct, encrypted connection is needed.
Port 587: The recommended port for secure email submission. It uses STARTTLS to upgrade a plain text connection to an encrypted one.
Port 2525: An alternative port for email submission, often used when other ports are blocked. 
 
Examples from major email providers
 
Gmail: smtp.gmail.com on port 587 (StartTLS) or 465 (SSL).
Microsoft 365: smtp.office365.com on port 587 (StartTLS).
Yahoo Mail: smtp.mail.yahoo.com on port 465 (SSL).
Hotmail/Outlook.com: smtp.live.com on port 587 (StartTLS) or 465 (SSL).
Comcast: smtp.comcast.net on port 587. 
 
GITHUB ACTIONS
In github action , jobs are run on runners
- Built in runners 
- Self - hosted run ers - For complex jobs
Workflows are alwas written in .github/workflow/file-name.yaml 
name - Description of your workflow
Event trigger - what makes the job start (on push, pull etc)
Job- Describe as stage in jenkns
