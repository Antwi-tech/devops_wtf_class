FIREWALLS
It is a hardware or software that accpets or declines traffic coming to a network based on rules
Functions
Prevents unauthorized networks
Filter netwrk packets
Protect virus and hackers
Enforce security headders

TYPES OF FIREWALL
Packet Filtering Firewall - works at layer 3
Stateful Inspection - Remembers connection and Stateless 
Proxy firewall
Clud frewall
Next Generation Firewall


sudo apt update
sudo apt install ufw

Assignment
Diable traficc from another user (ssh connect to another user)


sudo ufw allow SSH



basic UFW commands
 
installaton and initialization: sudo apt install(Ubuntu) sudo yum install epel-release && sudo yum install UFW(centos). Use sudo apt/yum ufw enable(disable) "enable" will enbale the firewall and "disable" will disable the firewall
 
Rules Management
sudo ufw allow PORT_NUMBER or SERVICE_NAME: allow incoming traffic on the specificied port e.g sudo ufw allow 443 or sudo ufw allow https
 
sudo ufw deny PORT_NUMBER or SERVICE_NAME: deny incoming traffic on the specificied port
 
sudo ufw reject PORT_NUMBER or SERVICE_NAME: similar to deny but it also sends a rejection message
 
sudo ufw allow PORT_NUMBER/PROTOCOL or SERVICE_NAME: allow incoming traffic on the specificied port e.g  sudo ufw allow 80/tcp or http/tcp
 
sudo ufw delete RULE_NUMBER: deletes the specified  rule from the ruleset
 
Status and Logging
sudo ufw status: Display the current UFW status and rules
sudo ufw status numbered: same as above but numbers the rules
sudo ufw logging on: Enable ufw logging
sudo ufw logging off: Disable ufw logging
 
 
Resetting UFW
sudo ufw reset:  Reset UFW to it's default settings

sudo iptables -L -V

iptables can be used to initiate firewalls too
sudo iptables -L -n - used to view iptables

iptables is the actual frewall
